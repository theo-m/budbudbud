# Budbudbud

Makes it easier to sync with friends and coworkers to settle on dates and places to work together _next week_.
Budbudbud is email first: once one of the group admin validates a meet, everyone receives a calendar invite on their mail.
Budbudbud sends emails to all group members on Friday so that everyone can provide their availablities.

Built with NextJS, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, tRPC, PostMark and NextAuth.
